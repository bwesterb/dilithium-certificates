# Algorithms and Identifiers for Post-Quantum Algorithms in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure

This repository is the working area for the Internet-Draft "Algorithms and Identifiers for Post-Quantum Algorithms in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure". 

Digital signatures are used within X.509 certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and to sign messages. This document describes the conventions for using Dilithium quantum-resistant signatures in Internet X.509 certificates and certifiate revocation lists.  The conventions for the associated post-quantum signatures, subject public keys, and private key are also described.
